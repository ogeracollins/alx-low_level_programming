# 0x18. C - Dynamic Libraries

Dynamic libraries in C provide a way to modularize and reuse code by creating shared libraries that can be loaded and linked into different programs at runtime. They offer several advantages, including code encapsulation, efficient memory usage, and flexibility.

## Introduction

Dynamic libraries, also known as shared libraries, are compiled object code files that contain reusable functions, data, and symbols. They are separate from the main executable and can be loaded and linked by multiple programs simultaneously, reducing redundancy and improving code maintenance.

C dynamic libraries offer the following benefits:

- **Code Reusability:** Dynamic libraries allow you to create modular code that can be shared across different applications, reducing development effort and promoting code reuse.

- **Dynamic Linking:** Libraries are linked dynamically at runtime, allowing programs to load and use functions and data only when needed, resulting in smaller executable sizes and efficient memory usage.

- **Versioning and Updates:** Dynamic libraries support versioning, allowing you to update the library independently without recompiling or relinking the entire application.
